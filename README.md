  - https://github.com/a-rolland/antoine-rolland-rokubun-application-server

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

It also automatically create a copy in the server : https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app-server

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
